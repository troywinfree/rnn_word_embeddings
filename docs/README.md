## README

These are my experiments with recursive neural networks for word embedding. I recorded additional information about the model, training, and challenges I encountered in the following Jupyter notebooks:

- [the_model](https://github.com/troywinfree/rnn_word_embeddings/blob/master/docs/the_model.ipynb): a description of the RNN model that I'm using
- [the_data](https://github.com/troywinfree/rnn_word_embeddings/blob/master/docs/the_data.ipynb): the sentence data and some visualizations
- [the_implementation](https://github.com/troywinfree/rnn_word_embeddings/blob/master/docs/the_implementation.ipynb):  a discussion of the model and training implementations
- more to come ...
