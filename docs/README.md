## README

These are my experiments with recursive neural networks for word embedding. I recorded additional information about the model, training, and challenges I encountered on the following pages:

- [the_model](https://github.com/troywinfree/rnn_word_embeddings/blob/master/docs/the_model.html) : a description of the RNN model that I'm using
- [the_data](https://github.com/troywinfree/rnn_word_embeddings/blob/master/docs/the_data.html) : the sentence data and some visualizations
- more to come ...
